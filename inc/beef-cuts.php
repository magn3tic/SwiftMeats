                    <p>The chuck primal comes from the shoulder area and yields cuts known for their rich, beefy flavor. Packed with muscle, chuck requires a little longer cook time, but it’s high fat content and affordable price make it a tasty and accessible option. Available in a variety of roasts, chuck is traditionally braised or turned into ground beef, but the recent rise in popularity of flat iron steak has brought a new audience and appreciation for this humble cut. </p>

                    <h4>2 - Brisket</h4>
                    <p>The brisket primal comes from the animal’s breast area and is the perfect cut to cook low and slow. Braising, smoking and roasting are all good ways to make sure your brisket comes out tender and juicy. Try it in a long-simmering roasting pot, a slow cooker, or smoked all day. </p>

                    <h4>3 - Shank</h4>
                    <p>The primal cut known as the shank is a portion of the animal's leg – and as such, it’s pretty packed with muscle and tendon. To get it tender, braise the meat low and slow, like in an osso buco, a traditional Italian dish made with cross-cut shanks, vegetables and broth.</p>

                    <h4>4 - Ribs</h4>
                    <p>The rib primal is situated under the front section of the backbone and is packed with some of the most popular beef cuts. The ribeye steak and the prime rib roast both come from this tender and flavorful primal. </p>

                    <h4>5 - Plate</h4>
                    <p>Right under the ribs is the plate primal cut, sometimes referred to as short plate or long plate, depending on, well, its length. It’s a somewhat fatty area, making the short ribs and skirt steaks cut from this part of the animal tender and flavorful. For a quick and delicious entrée, make fajitas with inside skirt steak. In minutes, cooks of every skill level can make a simple, tasty meal. </p>

                    <h4>6 - Short Loin</h4>
                    <p>Directly under the backbone is the loin primal cut, home to some of the most tender and desirable cuts of meat. It’s where you find the tenderloin, strip steak, T-bone steak and porterhouse steak. Each of these cuts is great cooked on the dry heat of the grill or broiled. For a rich and smoothly textured piece of beef, you can’t go wrong with the short loin. </p>

                    <p>Located just below the loin, the flank primal is a delicious, affordable alternative cut. Flank steak is best when marinated and then grilled quickly at a high temperature. When serving, make sure to slice against the grain to ensure the most tender eating experience. </p>

                    <h4>8 - Top Sirloin</h4>
                    <p>A versatile and flavorful cut, the Top Sirloin Steak is best for grilling. It can be cut and served as a steak or cut into smaller portions for kabobs. The Top Sirloin Steak carries an intense depth of flavor similar to a roast but cooks easy and quick like a steak. Top Sirloin Steaks are easy to prepare and are generally more affordable than other cuts which gained it the reputation as the "weeknight steak."</p>
                    <h4>Bottom Sirloin</h4>
                    <p>Known for leaner cuts of meat like the Tri-Tip and Sirloin Bavette, cuts from the Bottom Sirloin are best for roasting or grilling. This cut is often ground up to make burgers or thinly sliced for fajitas and barbecue.  </p>

                    <h4>9 - Tenderloin</h4>
                    <p>Found within the loin, beef tenderloin is among the most tender cuts of beef. Extending from the short loin into the sirloin, the filet mignon and chateaubriand come from the tenderloin cut. Due to the tenderness of the meat, beef tenderloin is great when cooked using dry-heat methods such as grilling or broiling.  </p>

                    <p>The sirloin primal hosts a variety of cuts, but it's first separated into the top sirloin and bottom sirloin. From this primal, you'll find cuts that are great for roasting or grilling like the tri-tip and sirloin bavette. For a delicious, juicy meal with any sirloin, marinate before cooking to retain moisture and add a kick of flavor. </p>

                    <h4>11 - Round</h4>
                    <p>If you want a roast, choose the round primal cut. The round is made up of the rump and hind legs of the animal. It is lean, inexpensive and delicious when slowly roasted. Round roasts are typically divided into three main sections: the top round, bottom round and the knuckle, also known as the sirloin tip. No matter which cut you land on, set some time aside to bring the natural flavors into a juicy, rich dish. </p>
