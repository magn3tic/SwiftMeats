                <h4>James - <a href="https://www.instagram.com/grillnation/" target="_blank">@grillnation</a><br><span>Memorial Day Judge</span></h4>
                <p>Some of the fondest memories James has are of the hours his family spent around the grill. Whether it was chicken, burgers or hot dogs, they were always favorites of his and his brothers. To the Brown family, grilling wasn’t just about food, it was about spending time together, bonding and creating lifelong memories. It only made sense that after James joined the Navy he would carry on the tradition. James remembered the joy and memories grilling brought him as a child and sought to bring that same atmosphere to his new set of brothers and sisters. In between deployments, James made a point of building camaraderie with his fellow service members from behind the coals of his grill. What started as a hobby for James seemed to have become a career overnight. After the success of his Facebook group, James grew the confidence to start posting his tutorials on Instagram and Tik Tok.</p>

                <p>Maciek is a backyard grill guy who loves cooking for his family and friends. Originally from Poland, he had his first taste of American BBQ at age 10 and was immediately hooked.</p>
                <p>His influencer cooking journey began in 2017 when his wife purchased a Green Egg for him for Father's Day and the rest is history. Maciek started an Instagram page shortly after receiving his grill to share what he was cooking with his followers. What started as a fun hobby turned into a full-blown passion. From cooking to grilling, sharing easy grill-focused recipes that anyone can replicate at home is what his page is all about.</p>

                <p>Miguel started cooking around five years ago and it all started on the Fourth of July. He invited his family over for a BBQ where he made some ribs on a smoker that he bought that day for $34. Sadly, the ribs were tough and flavorless, which struck a chord and gave him the drive to want to learn to cook. Miguel describes himself as someone who has a passion for cooking great food, which can be seen across his Instagram, TikTok and additional social media channels.</p>
